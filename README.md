# Storytelling App

This project is a storytelling application built using Next.js, designed to generate and customize stories based on user input. The application leverages AI to create engaging and personalized stories for users.

## Project Overview

The storytelling app allows users to create unique stories by specifying various parameters such as genre, characters, and plot details. The AI processes these inputs and generates a story that fits the given criteria. The app also includes features to evaluate and refine the generated stories.

### Features

- **Story Generation**: Generate stories using AI based on user-defined parameters.
- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Genre (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, romance, mystery)
  - Characters (e.g., names, traits, roles)
  - Plot details (e.g., setting, conflict, resolution)
- **Story Evaluation**: AI evaluates stories for coherence, creativity, and engagement.
- **Integration with Text Generation WebUI**: Serve text generation tasks using the WebUI.
